Created a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game with html, and JavaScript. Created based on lesson from The Odin Project from the following link
https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-revisiting-rock-paper-scissors. Utilized DOM manipulation.

This is not my original Repo for this project. Issues from merging my branch into my main forced me to delete my old repo and commits and create a new one with the code already finished.
